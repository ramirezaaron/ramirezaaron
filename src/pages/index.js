    <h1>Hi, there. </h1>

    <p>
      I'm a fullstack software developer. I like to write code, enjoy coffee and cats üêà 
    </p>

    <p>
      I've working for three years as employee and freelance. 
      Now, I'm focused on backend development, using mainly .NET Framework and PHP. 
    </p>

    <p>
      I did some research work while I was student 
      at <a href="http://cua.uam.mx/">Universidad Aut√≥noma Metropolitana</a>. 
      That work addressed tasks related to natural language processing and source 
      code plagiarism detection. There, I used machine learning stuff (algorithms and techniques). <br />
      I had a lot of learning and exciting experiences!
    </p>

    <p>
      If I'm not writing code, you can find me reading (books, news, trends), cooking, 
      biking or enjoying with my family and our cats. 
    </p>
