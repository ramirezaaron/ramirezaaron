## Hi!

I'm a software engineer. I've working on all the phases of development. I'm comfortable with creating from scratch (if it's required) but also I don't want to reinvent the wheel. 

I like to help people to solve their problems and enhance their workflow and I think that web, desktop, console and mobile applications can achieve that.

A few months ago, I have been working on data science topics, preparing and compiling data to get it ready to use in dashboards and visualizations. 

I enjoy to spend time with my cats and drink some coffee while I'm coding.
